"I do not have real-world experience in the tech industry yet, so I can mention some of the projects that I have created as coursework or assignments for my studies:

Chat application created using C programming for server-client socket programming.
Library management app built using Python's PyQt6 GUI toolkit with PostgreSQL.
SAP applications and my portfolio website developed using React.
Currently, I am very interested in C# programming language and recently completed a C# certification course from FreeCodeCamp and Microsoft."
